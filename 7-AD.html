                    <h1>THE JBL TUNE 220TWS</h1>


                    <p>This one is the that you should really go for, for it's supreme sound quality and the design.
                        This looks very trendy and is available in colours for every choice. It comes in mocha
                        brown-gray, a subtle blue, a quiet pink, green version which is brighter and definitely a black
                        and a white. The DESIGN looks very chic, perfect for the college students, working millenials
                        and is loved by the new age entrepreneurs. It looks a lot like the Apple AirPods but it is half
                        the price and a it is a new product in the market, so not a lot of your friends will have it.
                    </p>

                    <h1>JBL Partybox</h1>
                    <p>
                        This is the absolute PARTY banger, this speaker has crazy colorful lights to it that sync in
                        with the music. It creates the perfect vibe and attracts attention for it's size and looks. This
                        a comparatively bigger speaker for all the crazy house parties, it is big in size and a little
                        heave but has an attached trolley to it for functionality. This is a go to speaker if you have
                        regular house parties and want to make them 'cooler'. This would be a delight for all the
                        college goers.
